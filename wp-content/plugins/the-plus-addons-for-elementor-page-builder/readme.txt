**Elementor Panel in the editor is freezed and showing spinning circle.**

Make sure your memory limit is set to 768M or higher, If you have multiple elementor addons installed and you are having issue of elementor panel loading icon and freeze.

Does this is issue of The Plus Addons? No. This is not any one’s bug/issue. It’s just because, If you want to use more widgets, Your server need more memory limit to use everything in your backend. 

My Hosting Provider doesn’t allow higher memory limit, What to do? If that is the case, You just need to disable all unused widgets from The Plus Addons and all other addons you have installed. Which will reduce need of required memory limit as total number of active widgets will go down.
